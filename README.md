# Weather Temperature Prediction using Linear Regression

This is a basic machine learning project developed using **Linear Regression**. It was created as my first ML model to understand the concept of supervised learning.

## 📊 Dataset

The model uses a dataset named `weather.csv`, which contains various weather-related attributes. For this project, only **two attributes** were used:

- **Minimum Temperature (x)**
- **Maximum Temperature (y)**

The goal of the model is to predict the maximum temperature based on the given minimum temperature.

## 🧠 Algorithm

- **Linear Regression**  
  A simple regression model was trained using `scikit-learn` to establish a linear relationship between the two variables.

## 📁 Files

- `weather.csv` – The dataset used
- `weather_prediction.ipynb` – The Jupyter Notebook containing the model training and prediction code

## 📌 Note

This is a beginner-level project and was not deployed. It serves as a foundational step in my machine learning journey.
